# to.do

A mobile app to manage todo lists built with React Native (React Native CLI). It is a simple app that allows create, toggle as done/undone and remove tasks.

It should works perfectly in Android and iOS smartphones. Tasks are not stored, hence the data is lost when the app is closed (for now).
